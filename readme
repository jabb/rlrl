RLRL (Real Lite Roguelike) is a Roguelike game which focuses mainly on combat,
and little else. Combat is state-based: every creature has a state it's
currently in. Every creature also has actions. Each action can sometimes
require you and your target to be in specific states.

The interaction is done via a shell. You can map keypresses to a shell command
with the `map` command. Type `help` to get a list of commands. You can also
take a look at init.rlc, the startup script.

One of RLRL's goals is to be lightweight (obviously) and you can choose to build
rlrl with or without curses, although the without curses build may be glitchy on
some terminals (I suggest rxvt or xterm!).

Without curses:
make clean; make

With curses:
make clean; make curses
